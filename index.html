            Alan Guth was one of the first physicists to hypothesize the
            existence of inflation, which explains how the universe expanded so
            uniformly and so quickly in the instant after the Big Bang 13.8
            billion years ago. - Rick Friedman for The New York Times

            CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young
            physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s appointment
            at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations,
            venturing far beyond the world of known physics.
          </p>
          <p>
            He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic
            particles that should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he
            discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with. A
            potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could
            have infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a
            repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed
            of light for a prodigiously violent instant.
          </p>
          <p>
            If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the
            heavens look uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged, warped
            mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and
            irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be
            diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.
          </p>
          <p>
            “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page
            and drew a double box around it.
          </p>
          <p>
            On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported
            that they had seen the beginning of the Big Bang, and that his
            hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.
          </p>

            Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to
            <a href="#"> the first sliver of cosmic time </a> with telescopes at
            the South Pole, a team of astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the
            Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics detected ripples in the
            fabric of space-time — so-called gravitational waves — the signature
            of a universe being wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a
            trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. They are
            the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac
            and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.
